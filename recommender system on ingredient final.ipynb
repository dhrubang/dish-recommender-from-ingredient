      "0  Doddapatre Tambuli Recipe is a popular healing, nourishing cold yoghurt curry from Karnataka. Doddapatre, also known as Big Thyme in English, Ajwain leaves in Hindi, Karpooravalli in Tamil, Owa in Marathi and Pani Koorka in Malayalam - is known to have a lot of medicinal values. It has a very distinct smell and flavour to it, which resembles camphor and is known to improve digestion, relieve chest congestion and have overall good health benefits. It also reduces skin related issues when crushed and the juice applied on sensitive areas. Tambuli is a cold yoghurt curry made by grinding a herb, vegetable or spice with coconut and a handful of spices. Sometimes it is also given a tempering which enhances the flavours. Serve this Doddapatre Tambuli along with hot Steamed Rice and ghee as the first course during a South Indian lunch or dinner.   \n",

Trust me, it is equally as delicious as chicken tandoori. Normally, tandoori is prepared in tandoor oven, but I normally prepare it in my convection oven. The fish choice is completely upto you. Same recipe can be used for fillets too. I normally use pompano or kingfish for this recipe.   \n",

Doddapatre, also known as Big Thyme in English, Ajwain leaves in Hindi, Karpooravalli in Tamil, Owa in Marathi and Pani Koorka in Malayalam - is known to have a lot of medicinal values. It has a very distinct smell and flavour to it, which resembles camphor and is known to improve digestion, relieve chest congestion and have overall good health benefits. It also reduces skin related issues when crushed and the juice applied on sensitive areas. Tambuli is a cold yoghurt curry made by grinding a herb, vegetable or spice with coconut and a handful of spices. Sometimes it is also given a tempering which enhances the flavours. Serve this Doddapatre Tambuli along with hot Steamed Rice and ghee as the first course during a South Indian lunch or dinner.</td>\n",

       "0  Doddapatre Tambuli Recipe is a popular healing, nourishing cold yoghurt curry from Karnataka. Doddapatre, also known as Big Thyme in English, Ajwain leaves in Hindi, Karpooravalli in Tamil, Owa in Marathi and Pani Koorka in Malayalam - is known to have a lot of medicinal values. It has a very distinct smell and flavour to it, which resembles camphor and is known to improve digestion, relieve chest congestion and have overall good health benefits. It also reduces skin related issues when crushed and the juice applied on sensitive areas. Tambuli is a cold yoghurt curry made by grinding a herb, vegetable or spice with coconut and a handful of spices. Sometimes it is also given a tempering which enhances the flavours. Serve this Doddapatre Tambuli along with hot Steamed Rice and ghee as the first course during a South Indian lunch or dinner.   \n",

Trust me, it is equally as delicious as chicken tandoori. Normally, tandoori is prepared in tandoor oven, but I normally prepare it in my convection oven. The fish choice is completely upto you. Same recipe can be used for fillets too. I normally use pompano or kingfish for this recipe.   \n",

Doddapatre, also known as Big Thyme in English, Ajwain leaves in Hindi, Karpooravalli in Tamil, Owa in Marathi and Pani Koorka in Malayalam - is known to have a lot of medicinal values. It has a very distinct smell and flavour to it, which resembles camphor and is known to improve digestion, relieve chest congestion and have overall good health benefits. It also reduces skin related issues when crushed and the juice applied on sensitive areas. Tambuli is a cold yoghurt curry made by grinding a herb, vegetable or spice with coconut and a handful of spices. Sometimes it is also given a tempering which enhances the flavours. Serve this Doddapatre Tambuli along with hot Steamed Rice and ghee as the first course during a South Indian lunch or dinner.</td>\n",

Add these roasted spices also into the mixer jar.Add coconut, salt to the mixer too and grind it using half the quantity of yogurt, until it is a smooth paste.Transfer the paste into a serving bowl.

In the last step, add in the tomatoes, turmeric powder, green chillies, red chilli powder, garam masala powder and coriander powder.Stir all the ingredient well and add 3 cups of water to the Dal Chenchki mixture. Add in the salt to taste and cover the pressure cooker. Pressure cook until you hear 2 whistles, after which turn the heat to low and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally. The dal will be cooking more inside the cooker even when the heat is turned off.Once the pressure is released, you can then open the cooker and check the spice and saly levels and adjust according to taste.Finally stir in the chopped coriander leaves and stir. Serve the Dal Chenchki with Aloo Parwal Sabzi (another Bengali favorite) and hot rice, topped with ghee.</td>\n",

       "0     Doddapatre Tambuli Recipe is a popular healing, nourishing cold yoghurt curry from Karnataka. Doddapatre, also known as Big Thyme in English, Ajwain leaves in Hindi, Karpooravalli in Tamil, Owa in Marathi and Pani Koorka in Malayalam - is known to have a lot of medicinal values. It has a very distinct smell and flavour to it, which resembles camphor and is known to improve digestion, relieve chest congestion and have overall good health benefits. It also reduces skin related issues when crushed and the juice applied on sensitive areas. Tambuli is a cold yoghurt curry made by grinding a herb, vegetable or spice with coconut and a handful of spices. Sometimes it is also given a tempering which enhances the flavours. Serve this Doddapatre Tambuli along with hot Steamed Rice and ghee as the first course during a South Indian lunch or dinner.   \n",

Trust me, it is equally as delicious as chicken tandoori. Normally, tandoori is prepared in tandoor oven, but I normally prepare it in my convection oven. The fish choice is completely upto you. Same recipe can be used for fillets too. I normally use pompano or kingfish for this recipe.   \n",

The Dal Chenchki is a simple recipe made from red lentils (masoor dal) and combined with baby onions (shallots) and seasoned with ghee and mild spices. Serve the Dal Chenchki with Aloo Parwal Sabzi (another Bengali favorite) and hot rice, topped with ghee.   \n",

Heat a tablespoon of ghee in it, and add the doddapatre leaves to the ghee. Sauce them gently on a medium heat until they change colour and sweat. continue to saute until all the water they release has evaporated. The leaves will change colour and reduce to half the quantity.Take them out of the kadai and transfer them into a mixer and set the jar aside.In the same kadai, dry roast jeera and black pepper corns till the jeera turns dark in colour and aromatic. Add these roasted spices also into the mixer jar.Add coconut, salt to the mixer too and grind it using half the quantity of yogurt, until it is a smooth paste.Transfer the paste into a serving bowl. Top it up with the remaining yogurt and whisk until it is smoothly combined.Place a tadka ladle on the heat and melt some ghee in it. When the ghee is warm, add the cumin seeds, allow them crackle, and pour the tempering over the tambuli.Mix well and serve child along with Steamed Rice.   \n",

Wash it really well and apply salt on both the sides .Keep for about 10 minutes. In a bowl, mix together all the marination ingredients together really well including curd, onions, green chiliies, tandoori masala, ginger garlic paste, red chilli powder, garam masala powder, cumin powder, coriander leaves, salt and apply it to the fish on both the sides, pressing the mixture inside the slits really well .Keep it covered for about 40 to 50 minutes for marination. The longer is better.Preheat you oven to 400 degree Fahrenheit. Lightly brush the grill with oil and place the fish over the grill.Place your grill on the baking tray and bake for about 20 minutes.To check the fish whether baked well, insert a toothpick and check if it feel soft and light. If it does, remove the stick out and serve hot.Serve Fish Tandoori Recipe as an appetiser or as a side dish with Posto Chicken and Steamed Rice for your weekday dinner.   \n",

Allow it to cool completely and firm up.The next step in making the Arbi Shimla Mirch Sabzi Recipe, heat about a tablespoon of oil in a heavy bottomed pan; add the ginger and capsicum.Saute for a few minutes until the capsicum is tender and begin to start changing color.

I typically like to quarter the onions and then add it to the dal, but traditionally it is added as a whole.Once the onions are roasted, add in the masoor dal and roast for about a minute on medium heat until you smell more aromatic flavors. In the last step, add in the tomatoes, turmeric powder, green chillies, red chilli powder, garam masala powder and coriander powder.Stir all the ingredient well and add 3 cups of water to the Dal Chenchki mixture. Add in the salt to taste and cover the pressure cooker. Pressure cook until you hear 2 whistles, after which turn the heat to low and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally. The dal will be cooking more inside the cooker even when the heat is turned off.Once the pressure is released, you can then open the cooker and check the spice and saly levels and adjust according to taste.Finally stir in the chopped coriander leaves and stir. Serve the Dal Chenchki with Aloo Parwal Sabzi (another Bengali favorite) and hot rice, topped with ghee.   \n",

      "Instructions: To begin making the Jalebi Recipe, we will first begin the preparation by mixing the maida, corn flour, baking soda, ghee and turmeric powder in a medium bowl.  Combine all the dry ingredients well, until well combined.Add yogurt to the dry ingredients and blend them all together to make a thick batter by adding very little water. The consistency of the batter should be thick and not watery, similar to the butter cream batter. You should be able to make a shape when piped in a piping bag.When done, cover the jalebi batter and place it in a warm place for 24 hours or overnight, till it is fermented (the batter will rise on fermentation). Once the batter is fermented stir the batter in a cut and fold motion to combine it once again.Dont over stir you want the air pockets in the batter to remain. This will help in the jalebi being crisp and also in turn help it absorb the sugar syrup.To make the sugar syrup, boil the sugar with water and saffron powder in a small bowl on medium heat until the sugar dissolves. When the sugar becomes thick and stringy of one string consistency.Turn off the heat and keep aside.Now to make the jalebis, preheat the oil for deep frying. Once the oil is hot enough, you will know this, when you add a drop of batter in and it will come rising to the top almost immediately.Once you have filled the piping bag, pipe spirals of the batter onto the medium hot oil, until you get at least 3 concentric circles. Fry the jalebi on medium heat until golden brown in colour and crisp. Once the jalebi is crisp and browned, drain the excess oil out and immediately dip the jalebi into the hot sugar syrup.Piping the jalebis into the medium hot oil takes a little experience, the more you pipe the more practice you will get and the better you get at it. The Jalebis should rest in the sugar syrup for at least a minute, after which they can be drained out of the excess syrup and then served.Enjoy these crisp, sweet Homemade Jalebis as a wonderful dessert or a sweet option for your guests.Serve the Homemade Jalebi Recipe as a Indian Party Dessert for the festival of Holi or Diwali.Note:Ensure the batter is thick and firm, or else they won’t retain the shape of the jalebis. The oil for frying should be medium hot. If it is too hot, the jalebis will end up burnt.Also make sure you keep the heat on low when you pipe the jalebis into the oil, this will ensure you can see the circles you are piping and also the jalebis will rise up slowly.\n",

      "Instructions: To begin making the Aloo Gobi Sabzi Recipe, chop cauliflower into florets and wash well in plenty of water; drain and keep aside.Wash potatoes, peel and chop into medium-sized cubes; keep aside.In a medium sized deep saucepan or kadai, heat oil or ghee.Once the oil heats up, lower the heat and add the spices (turmeric, chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder and hing); sauté for a few seconds.Increase the heat and immediately, add the cubed potatoes; stir well to coat with spices.Add a little bit of salt and sauté on high for about a minute or so.Stir in the cauliflower flowerets and additional salt; give it a good stir.Once the vegetables and spices have mixed well, lower the heat, close the saucepan and cook on medium low heat till the vegetables are cooked.  Keep stirring in between so as not to burn the vegetables. Do not add any water.Once the vegetables have cooked to your desired consistency, turn the heat off, remove from flame.Garnish with crushed dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi) or chopped coriander leaves.To give it an acidic element, give it a squeeze of lime or lemon juice.Serve Aloo Gobi Sabzi along with Panchmel Dal and Phulkas for a weekday meal. You can also serve Boondi Raita with this meal.\n",
